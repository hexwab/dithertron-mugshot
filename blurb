DITHERTRON

This is a fork of 8-Bit Workshop's _Dithertron_ tool.  Take a mugshot,
dither it and send it to the BBC through the cassette port!

Recommended settings are "MODE 1", "Perceptual" colour and "Stucki" dithering.

After the conference there'll be a GALLERY of people's pics, as well as SOURCE CODE and DISC IMAGES.

Make a note of your picture ID and later you can download your pic and see it on your own hardware (or emulator).

CAN I HACK IT?

Sure! Try pausing or seeking the audio to see how the beeb reacts.
The screen turns MAGENTA if it's detected something awry and has given
up on this image.  How far can you push the tape interface?

If you break the beeb, power-cycle it, type "*T." then "*/", then play
"mugshot.wav" from the open VLC window.  Please leave it in the state
you found it.

Please don't try to break the webapp.  We all know you know how to
break webapps.
